I completed the required changes (added my name, profile picture, bio, project 1, 2, and 3 details, my GitHub profile, and my LinkedIn profile).
I personalized the website by changing the colors. I changed the general theme of the website from blue to red by making both the header and footer red and changing the blue tinted elements, like the background of the About Me section, to be red tinted instead.
