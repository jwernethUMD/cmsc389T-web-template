                <p>I'm Jason Werneth, a sophomore computer science major. Since I first started
                    coding during my junior year of high school, I've been enjoying learning new
                    computer science concepts. Outside of computer science, I love running and
                    climbing!

                    <h2>Custom Chess</h2>
                    <p> I used React to create a unique chess game with options to enable/disable 
                        castling and check/checkmate detection (it would not be allowed for a piece
                        that is protecting the king from being in check to move out of the
                        way, in addition to similar restrictions). Users can change the ways that
                        pieces can move (for example, a user could make a bishop move 3 squares
                        forward while only moving 1 square sideways, or could make a rook that can’t
                        move to the right unless it goes diagonal.)
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="column reveal" style="background-color:#BFB5B9;">
                    <h2>Osort</h2>
                    <p> I used the osu API with Python to get osu players’ ”top plays” given their 
                        osu ID and obtain specified details about each ”play.” I also sorted plays 
                        by selected criteria (some property of the map/score, such as a map’s ”star
                        rating”) using python. Additionally, I used Flask to process user inputs 
                        and put the results into a leader board format.</p>

                <div class="column reveal" style="background-color:#D1CACD;">
                    <h2>Sliding Midpoint KD-Tree</h2>
                    <p> I created a version of a 2 dimensional kd-tree (a binary search tree that
                        stores 2-dimensional points) that uses a sliding-midpoint rule to partition
                        the points. The tree stores the points in a way such that they are efficient 
                        to find by dividing the box into cells, which it attempts to make as square
                        as possible by starting the divide at the midpoint of the cell, and then if 
                        all the point are on one side, shifting to the closest point to the midpoint.
                        This is implemented as an extended binary tree, meaning it has InternalNodes
                        that each have 2 children and ExternalNodes with no children.
